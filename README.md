# Jammming
Jammming is a simple React app built with the guidance of Codecademy's "Full-Stack Engineer" career path. 

The purpose is to create a simple app that allows users to:

- connect their Spotify account to the app;
- search for songs, artists, albums;
- add selected songs to a new playlist;
- name the playlist;
- save it to their own Spotify account.

The things that I learned and practiced during the creation of this app were:

- how to create stateful and stateless components;
- how to pass props from one component to another;
- how to pass a state as a prop to a component;
- how to use Fetch API to make GET and POST requests;
- how to handle promises and data that they might return.
